                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>As part of my studies on Game Engineering in Saxion University, I did a 6-months research
                    project
                    (January 2020 – June 2020) called “Minor Skilled”.<br>
                    The final product a game created in a 3D Game Engine, implemented from scratch in C++ using
                    ECS as
                    the main architecture design.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The purpose of this report is to share my research by answering the following question: <b>What benefits does ECS
                    architecture bring to Game and Engine development?</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    I will describe the work showcased in this report in three main parts. The first part comprises of a brief
                    introduction to the Enity-Component-System architecture and show my implementation of this
                    design, which I named <b>Feather</b>. In the second part, I explain the 3D engine called
                    <b>Crow</b>
                    and how feather was used to implement these complex engine systems.
                    Last part of the work showcased will be about the game called <b>Graveyard Warz</b>, and some of the
                    gameplay system
                    built using ECS architecture.

                <h5>What is ECS?</h5>
                <p> Traditionally, games were used to be programmed in a object oriented desing (OOP) or inheritance
                    design. For example, a class <b>Creature</b> inherits the base <b>Gameobject</b> class and then there
                    might be a class
                    <b>Human</b> and <b>Orc</b> which inherit <b>Creature</b> class and so on. Then every frame the
                    program goes through all the Entities and call some
                    methods
                    like <b>Render</b> or <b>Update</b>.<br>
                    The first problem with this approach is that our architecture is
                    rigid, meaning that if another class <b>Necromancer</b> wants to be both an <b>Orc</b> and
                    a <b>Vampire</b>, the whole program architecture has to be redesigned.
                    <br>The second problem with the OOP is related to the performance. When iterating through all these Entities
                    calling
                    <b>Update</b>, the CPU is jumping in memory and pulling data in cache,but since our entities are
                    scattered
                    around in memory that cache is not used the next frame thus the
                    CPU has to go and fetch that data from RAM every single time, so essentially our CPU power is wasted
                    due to the fact that you have to wait for the data to process.

                <p>
                    Nowadays the industry has shifted to <b>Component System</b> design for solving the problem
                    mentioned above.
                    For example, in Unity's Component System <a href="https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/Components.html">[1]</a>
                    there is a <b>Gameobject</b> to which components can be
                    added as building blocks and then <b>Update</b> is called on those
                    components every frame.The first issue is solved since, <b>Vampire</b> and <b>Orc</b> components
                    can be attached to a GameObject which will then act accordingly. However the
                    second problem still remains, since the program is still jumping in memory
                    and calling <b>Update</b> on all of these components.<br>
                    If you have a look at the picture in the right, which represents how a component system memory layout
                    might look like,
                    the problem becomes more noticeable. The program is moving all around memory in one frame and wasting
                    CPU cycles.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="col-md-6 align-self-center">
                <img class="sidePicture" src="Assets/componentMemoryLayout.png" width="659" height="240"><br><br>
                <p class="Footnote " style=" margin-top: -20px;">Unity's Component system Memory Layout <a
                        href="https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/get-started-with-the-unity-entity-component-system-ecs-c-sharp-job-system-and-burst-compiler.html">[2]</a>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-md-6">
                <p>
                    In order for the second problem to be solved, the memory layout needs to be re-organised so thatthe
                    components
                    that are iterated regularly are tightly packed together.
                    For example if all gameobjects are needed to move, all the transforms would be iterated and the
                    position would be changed.
                    However these transforms have to be grouped in memory together.
                    Then when the CPU request one transform it will fetch a bunch of them (as much as it can fit
                    in
                    one cache line) and store them in cache for the next frame.Then next iteration
                    another transform is needed,they might are already stored in cache hence saving the CPU a lot of
                    time.
                    <br>Introducing <b>Enity-Component-System</b> approach, in this design,an entity is just an
                    index to
                    a group or collection of components. All the components are stored in tightly
                    packed array and those contain only data and they are also known as POD(Plain Old
                    Data)
                    structures. Instead of components updating themselves we have systems
                    which iterate through all entities which have a specified set of components and update their data.
                    For example the Rigidbody system will operate only on entities which have the Rigidbody and
                    Transform component.
                    If an entity has neither or just one of these components the system wont update their data.<br>
                    Unity Engine is now also moving towards this architecture with their new DOTS <a

                    In this section my own implementation of ECS architecture called Feather will be explained.
                    First the overall Architecture will be shown and then speed tests as well as actual code
                    snippets
                    will be displayed,
                    showcasing how it is like developing using Feather.<br>
                    The full open sourced codebase for Feather can be found <a

                <p>
                    In Feather <b>Entities</b> are just an unsigned integers which are used to get the index in a
                    set of
                    components.
                    <b>Components</b> in Feather are just structs of data.
                    <b>Systems</b> is where the functionality is implemented, the user can create their own systems
                    and
                    can iterate
                    through the entities in the world. There are multiple ways of iteration which are shown later in
                    this report.

                    Except the main concepts like Entities,Components and Systems there are a few more "Classes"
                    that
                    the user needs to understand
                    in order to use Feather:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>EntityRegistry</b>: Keeps track of all the entities in the world. It creates and destroys
                        entities.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>ComponentRegistry</b>: Keeps track of all Component Sparse Sets. If the user needs access
                        to
                        a Component set of a certain type this registry is responsible for providing it.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>SystemRegistry</b>: Keeps track of all systems, allocates system memory and provides
                        access
                        to the users for all the registered systems.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>ComponentSparseSet</b>: Is a custom collection type created for the purpose of storing
                        component data contiguous in memory. It allows the users to create,get and destroy
                        components.A
                        more in depth explanation of this class will be shown in the <b>Memory Layout</b> Section.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>World</b>: Is the core class of Feather. It serves as a factory to all registries, that
                        means
                        that the user only needs to work with the world class and the world class with update the
                        registries accordingly. For example, if the user destroys an entity via the world class, the
                        world class will inform all the registries that the entity is destroyed and they will
                        internally
                        be updated correctly.<br>
                        Examples on how to use the world class and Feather will be shown in the the <b>Workflow</b>
                        section.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>EntityHandle</b>: This small class provides a workflow similar to unity for entities. It
                        wraps the active world and an entity and instead of updating an entity with the world you
                        update
                        the EntityHandle and it will internally update the world.<br>
                        Similar to the world class, more examples of how EntityHandle works will be shown in the
                        <b>Workflow</b>
                        section.
                    </li>

                <h5 id="memorylayout">Memory Layout</h5>
                <p>As mentioned before a key advantage of ECS is providing good memory layout.<br>
                    All memory that feather uses is allocated in the beginning of the application.There is no
                    runtime
                    heap allocations done by Feather. The memory is partitioned correctly and marked as valid or
                    invalid based on users input. When a component is marked for destruction, the component is moved
                    and
                    it wont be updated, however it wont be deleted from memory until the user explicitly needs the
                    data
                    to be deleted
                    (Usually done in the end of the application's lifetime).<br>
                    Components in feather are stored in a custom collection called <b>ComponentSparseSet</b>.
                    In Feather a ComponentSparseSet is just 3 C style arrays:
                <ul>
                    <li>Component Dense array: In this array all the components are stored contiguously(one after
                        another).
                    </li>
                    <li>Entity Dense array: In this array all the entities which contain the component are stored
                        contiguously(one after another)
                    </li>
                    <li>Index Sparse array: The index array is sparse meaning its data is not contiguous. Instead
                        the
                        indexes of which the entity
                    </li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                    The reason why the 3 arrays are needed is to answer the problem <b>What happens if a component is
                    marked
                    to be removed?</b> The pictures below is needed to show why this is a problem.
                    The picture represents a simplified visualisation of how the components are stored in
                    memory.
                    As said before the ComponentSparseSet contains 3 arrays and those arrays are displayed in a
                    table
                    format.
                    Now the max size is set to 5 elements and it is empty.

                    <img class=" FullPicture justify-content-center" src="Assets/componentLayout0.png" width="650"
                         height="174">

                </p>

                <p>
                    So what happens when "C1" is added to Entity "0"(entities being just unsigned integers) to our set?<br>
                    It is immediately added in the first available slot in the array, in this case it is slot 0.<br>
                    In the entity array Entity "0" is added to the first available slot too.
                    Last in the index array, the index at which the entity's component is stored is added
                    and we store it at the 0 index since our Entity = 0.<br>
                    Now we have mapped Entity->Index and Index->Entity.This is important when we destroy a component.
                    <img class=" FullPicture justify-content-center" src="Assets/componentLayout1.png" width="650"
                         height="174">
                </p>

                <p>
                    Components "C2,C3,C4" are added to the Entity "1,2,3" respectively and the arrays are updated
                    as shown before.<br>
                    But what happens if we remove a component from this set?
                    <img class=" FullPicture justify-content-center" src="Assets/componentLayout2.png" width="650"
                         height="174">
                </p>

                <p>
                    What happens if "C3" needs to be removed from the set? At first "C3" and "C4" are swapped in the
                    dense
                    component array then<br>
                    the Entity->Index and Index->Entity need to be swapped as well, since next time we need to get "C4"
                    the
                    Entity needs to point to the updated index.
                    In the Entity dense array the same thing needs to be done, so the entity to remove is swapped with
                    the last entity.
                    In the index sparse array the entity index needs to be updated.<br>
                    As it is shown the index sparse array has holes in it but that is not a problem since it is never
                    iterated
                    , it is only needed when a component is removed and the set needs to remain packed.<br>
                    In case the user needs to get "C4", first it's location will be found by using it's Entity value(in this
                    case 3)
                    to find the right index.
                    Then in the index array, the 3rd element is retrieved which is 2 meaning that the "C4" is
                    located in the 2nd index of the dense array.
                    <img class=" FullPicture justify-content-center" src="Assets/componentLayout3.png" width="650"
                         height="174">
                </p>

                <p>
                    Finally "C1" is removed from the set.
                    Again "C1" and "C4" are swapped with each other and "C4"'s index is updated to point in the location
                    where "C1" used
                    to
                    be.<br>
                    Afterwards the array will always remain packed, and it can be iterated safely.
                    The swapping cost
                    is not that high since its just two C-style array look-ups and the lookup is done only when a
                    component
                    needs to be removed which is not that frequent.
                    However the benefits are big since the data that is active and needed is always contiguous in
                    memory.

                        <h6>Feather Vs OOP</h6>

                        <p>
                            First Feather Vs Object-Oriented approach was tested. Two programs were created which
                            involved
                            two different
                            types of entities, <b>Orcs</b> and <b>Nobles</b>.
                            In the OOP they are classes inheriting from other base classes. While in
                            ECS/Feather
                            they are just two simple components. The behaviour itself is very trivial,
                            in this case the iteration speed is the focus of the test.<br>
                            Three different cases were tested, one with 1000 "Orcs" and "Nobles", one with 10,000 and
                            one
                            with
                            100,000. The program is executed for 1000 frames and in order to get a consistent result the
                            app
                            is executed 100 times.<br>
                            The results are displayed graphically in the right. The X-axis shows the number of time
                            the
                            program was executed and
                            the Y-axis shows the time in milliseconds it took for 1000 frames.<br>
                            In all three cases Feather performs much better then OOP when we iterate
                            through components/behaviours.
                            There are two main reasons why OOP performs worst than Feather.<br>
                            First one is is related to the fact that the data in Feather is contiguous in memory,
                            thus the CPU cache saves cycles by storing the data we might need the next frame.<br>
                            The second reason is concept known in OOP as <b>Double Dispatching</b> which in this
                            case is
                            a call to the virtual "Update" function. Double-Dispatching
                            requires a V-table lookup and that is also located somewhere scattered in memory thus
                            waisting CPU cycles.

                        <h6>Feather Vs Component System (Unity)</h6>
                        <br>

                        <p>
                            The second test performed was against Unity and it's current component system. For
                            this
                            test the
                            steering and flocking behaviour systems build in Unity are the same one as the ones used in
                            final game in C++.
                            The unity program only
                            spawns a bunch of spheres and gives them a target to seek while they try to keep
                            distance
                            from each other using basic
                            O(n2) flocking.<br>
                            As shown in the video on the right, after 300-400 spheres the frames drop under
                            30
                            FPS and at 500 spheres the framerate is very low. The current spheres have
                            no collider attached to them and the most expensive calculation is done by the Flocking
                            Behaviour component.<br>
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In the second video the same systems are tested in Feather and in an custom C++ Game
                            Engine
                            (<b>Crow</b>).
                            The performance difference is noticeable, now there are way more units, 3-4 times more then
                            Unity
                            while
                            keeping a steady high framerate.
                            After 1200 the FPS drops exponentially since the flocking is done O(n2). The Feather
                            performs better while also having other
                            gameplay systems running in addition to flocking system.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are many things that could be done to even get more units on the screen. For
                            example
                            the flocking and collision instead of being performed
                            in O(n2) they could be performed in logarithmic complexity by introducing spacial
                            partitioning algorithms. There are also rendering optimisation that
                            could be implemented such as batching for all the meshes. However the goal was to test
                            the
                            same systems running in an equal environment.

                First Feather needs to be set up. In order for Feather to function we need to create
                the
                3 main registries, the Entity,Component and system registry.
                After creating these registries, the next step will be about creating a world which will act as an context and it will
                communicate with all the registries. The world needs to be initialized by calling the "Init" function
                and passing the registries,
                this
                way the world is ready to be used and knows which memory it has to operate on.

                Since components are just data, they are very simple to create. The only thing needed to create a
                component is a struct with our values inside, that's it.
                As displayed below, a position component which holds an "X","Y" values and a gravity component
                which
                defines a "gravityValue" are created.

            <p>
                Systems are not that complicated to create either. As stated before systems define the behaviour of
                our
                program. The first picture below
                displays how to set a the signature of a system. This is only required if systems need to
                know
                about which entities to iterate on
                beforehand and let the <b>World</b> automatically update the entities set for the user.The line below is
                telling Feather that the <b>GravitySystem</b>
                needs to iterate on entities which have <b>both</b> a <b>Position</b> and a <b>Gravity</b>
                component.<br>
                This is one of the ways to iterate components in ECS
                architecture. In the further sections, other ways to iterate components and what are the benefits of
                each
                way will be explained. <br>

                The second picture below is an example of
                how a gravity system would look like. First custom system needs to inherit base <b>System</b> class,
                this way we let feather know that this class
                is a system and it gives a bunch of functions to override such as Init,Update,Render etc. In the
                "Update" function
                all the entities which fit this system's signature are iterated and their <b>Position</b> and
                <b>Gravity</b>
                components are retrieved. Then the <b>Position</b> component is updated based on "gravityValue" of the
                <b>Gravity</b>
                component.
                <br><br>

                <img class="center" src="Assets/codeSnippets/signature.png" width="631" height="48"><br>
                <img class="center" src="Assets/codeSnippets/systemSnippet.png" width="756" height="346">
            </p>

            <p>
                Another way of iterating components is to use the <b>EntitiesWith</b> function of the <b>World</b>
                class. <b>EntitiesWith</b>
                is a Query function which returns a list of Entities which contain a given case of components in
                this
                case a <b>Position</b> and <b>Gravity</b>
                component. Internally this function takes the smallest set of the given component and checks which
                of
                it's entities is located in any of the other
                component sets and return those to the user.<br>
                After list of entities is retrieved, the entities can be iterated and updated just as in the example
                above.
                <br><br>

                <img class="center" src="Assets/codeSnippets/entitiesWithSnippet.png" width="814" height="385"><br>

            </p>

            <p>
                An even easier way to iterate component is using the <b>ForEach</b> function. It takes a function as
                a
                parameter and provides the references
                to the entity and components automatically. This is similar to how Unity iterates components in
                their
                <b>DOTS</b> api.<br>
                Now the components don't have to be retrieved from the entity since they are automatically filled in by
                the
                world and instead the user can focus on writing their behaviour
                inside the lambda function.
                <br><br>

                <img class="center" src="Assets/codeSnippets/ForEachSnippet.png" width="945" height="248"><br>

            </p>

            <p>
                The last way to query entities and components in Feather is using the <b>FindEntities</b> function.
                This function
                will return all the entities that fit
                a conditional function given as parameter. As presented in the example below, all the entities
                which have a <b>Position</b> component and have
                their position's "X","Y" values equal to 0 are retrieved.<br>
                Then these entities can be iterated and updated accordingly, in the example below they are just
                destroyed.
                <br><br>

                <img class="center" src="Assets/codeSnippets/FindEntitiesSnippet.png" width="1025" height="203"><br>

            </p>

            <p>
                In order for systems and components to work, the user has to allocate memory for them.
                This way all the memory is allocated upfront
                so there is no heap allocation at runtime.
                If for example a new world needs to be loaded,the same memory can be used,instead of deleting memory and
                allocating it again.<br>
                Another good thing about this approach is that it minimises null errors in runtime since all of the
                memory is valid and partitioned correctly.
                <br><br>

                <img class="center" src="Assets/codeSnippets/AllocatingMemorySnippet.png" width="660"
                     height="134"><br>

            </p>


            <p>
                Lastly the only thing left to do in order for the application to work is create the entities and
                attach
                components to them.An <b>EntityHandle</b>
                can be created by the world and then any type of component can be attached to it. This components have
                to
                be allocated before being added otherwise an
                error will be thrown.
                The last line just updates all the systems registered to the world. And that is everything needed to
                set
                up and work with <b>Feather</b>.

            <p>
                As mentioned above in this report,the goal is to research the question <b>What benefits does ECS
                architecture bring to Game and Engine development?</b>
                In this section the focus will be <b>What features does the Crow Engine offer and how were they
                build
                using Feather(ECS)?</b><br>
                Crow engine provides the basics feature a game engine needs to get the user up and running. It has a
                Renderer and Material workflow, window and input API,
                Game Loop, ResourceManager for loading and maintaining assets, and support for using Unity as an
                editor
                tool, however only in this section only the
                <b>Renderer</b> and <b>Unity as editor</b> will be explored since this is where the ECS architecture
                was
                needed to be used the most.

            <h5 id="renderer">The Renderer</h5>


            <p>
                Since one of the core systems of every game engine is it's renderer, naturally the question of how
                your
                architecture will support your renderer rises.
                In this case <b>How to build an ECS renderer and what are it's benefits?</b><br>
                One of the main problems with an ECS renderer is fitting the drawable objects into cache. Meshes
                and
                materials can be big in terms of byte size and might not fit inside
                a cache line so in order to benefit from data-oriented architecture, a way to fit as
                much as possible in a cache line needs to be found.<br>
                How the Crow Engine approaches the problem is by splitting the data. So in the picture below there
                is a
                <b>Meshinfo</b> component set and instead of holding
                a reference to both a material and the mesh, it holds a pointer to a material array and a mesh
                array.
                This way the <b>MeshInfo</b> component is small
                in size (it only has 2 pointers) but also it points to packed arrays of meshes and materials. The
                same
                thing is done for materials and shaders, since
                multiple materials can use the same shader, a pointer to the shader is stored in the material.<br>

                By doing rendering in ECS style the scene can be sorted easily. The Crow Engine supports instanced
                rendering and how that works is when a shader is buffered to the GPU,
                a list of all the transformation matrices is sent to the GPU for each model and material pair. This way
                we save a lot of the draw calls the
                GPU would have to do otherwise.<br>

                Another benefit of this approach is that if we were doing something to all the materials we would
                not
                need to touch the mesh part of the memory, instead we just
                put all the materials we need in cache.<br><br>

                <h6>Renderer Performance Test</h6>

                <p>
                    In order to test the speed of the ECS renderer, the same rendering application was created both
                    in
                    Unity and Crow Engine. The application is
                    10,000 meshes rotating at a random speed. For the test to be fair an unlit material is attached
                    to
                    the meshes in both engines so the lighting would
                    not affect anyhow the performance.<br><br>
                    The top video on the right shows the Unity engine result. In unity the app performs around 6-8 FPS
                    while as it is shown in the bottom right video
                    the exact same application in the Crow Engine performs in a constant 16-17 FPS.<br><br>
                    The main reason why the ECS renderer performs better in this situation is because of how fast
                    the
                    cpu is able to iterate and work on contiguous memory. As shown above,
                    all the Meshes,Materials and Shaders are stored as packed together in memory.<br><br>
                    The Crow Engine renderer is not a better renderer then Unity's Renderer, this test is only
                    showcasing how the data-oriented architecture is more efficient.
                    There are many improvement that could be done here like <b>Batching</b> and <b>Multi-threaded
                    Rendering</b> but these were not the scope of the project and did not
                    fit into the the main goal.<br><br>
                    Another reason the custome renderer is able to perform better is not only because of the way
                    material,shaders and
                    meshes(in this case) are stored in memory but also because they are sorted
                    at runtime in order to have as little shader swaps as possible. This way the instance rendering
                    is
                    implemented and saves the GPU draw calls but also the GPU does not have
                    to swap shaders as often, which is a fairly expensive opertation.

                Crow Engine uses Unity as an editor. All the Crow Engine main components are supported and
                serialised from Unity. The Unity scene is serialised into
                an <b>XML</b> file format which can then loaded and parsed in the crow engine. The flipping of
                coordinate system from <b>Left-Handed</b> to <b>Right-Handed</b>
                is done automatically by the parser.<br> The scene hierarchy is also mantained meaning child-parent
                relations are
                parsed into the Crow engine as they are in the Unity engine.

            <p>
                The  bottom picture in the left shows the scene in Unity and that in the right shows  the same scene parsed by Crow engine. The parser
                will create all the entities and attach all the supported components based on the XML File generated
                from Unity.

                    <h6>Component Serialisation</h6>
                    <p>
                        As mentioned before in <b>ECS</b> architecture the components are just strucutres of data.
                        This makes serialisation of the
                        components trivial. All the supported engine components work dynamically with Unity's
                        components.For example in the video on the right
                        the light component when changed is also chaning unity's light component automatically. This
                        way changes are visible immediately
                        in the Unity engine and then can be exported for the Crow engine.<br>

                        The engine supported components are :
                    <ul>
                        <li>Camera Component</li>
                        <li>Light Component</li>
                        <li>AudioSource Component</li>
                        <li>Texture Material</li>

                    <h6>Asset Serialisation</h6>
                    <p>
                        Another feature of the parser is that it can serialise assets from unity. All the user has
                        to do is place
                        the texture or model into the right folder in unity and parse the file. The file parset is a
                        <b>.asset</b> file, which
                        is a custom serialisation format created for the loading of assets in the Crow Engine. As
                        shown in the picture on the right,
                        the format is very easy to read. The <b>"#"</b> is a type identifier meaning anything after
                        it represents the type of the asset.
                        Anything after the <b>":"</b> is the path of that asset.<br>
                        Once the file is generated from unity, next time the Crow Engine loads it will automatically
                        load all the assets.<br>
                        The custom format is very fast to be interpreted as it is written fully in C and since it
                        has a very simple way of identifying tokens.

            <p>
                <b>Graveyard Warz</b> is a game build using <b>Feather</b> and the
                <b>Crow Engine</b>. The main reason
                it was created is to showcase the <b>The benefits of the ECS in Game development</b>. In the
                <b>Speed Test</b> section of Feather
                a stress test of the game was showcased, where alot of units were spawned and simulated. In this
                section, the focus will be how ECS
                helped in the workflow of developing the game and show how it evolved during development, from the
                prototype phase
                to the polishing phase.

                <h5>About the game</h5>

                <p>
                    Graveyard Warz is a <i>Tug of War</i> game, where you purchase units and lead them to the
                    enemy's portal.
                    The player battles against the AI and whoever manages to empty the other's health bar wins the game.
                    The game is also in 3D
                    making it different from other games of the similar genre which are 2D.<br><br>
                    The image in the top right is a moodboard for the initial style of the game and the bottom picture
                    is concept art made by an artist in order to
                    help me visualise a more concrete version of the game.<br><br>
                    In the final game the user can choose three different units to spawn. The first one is the <b>Melee
                    Group</b> unit which when purchased
                    spawns 16 small units that try to reach the enemy's portal as soon as possible. Another unit is the
                    <b>Tank</b>, who will block the path
                    of all units and has more health then the other units. The last unit type is the <b>Cannon</b> unit,
                    it targets the closest enemy on the path
                    and jumps towards them dealing a lot of damage. The player gains money every second but also when an
                    enemy unit is defeated.
                    The unit design is an <i>Rock-Paper-Scissor</i> RTS design. Where the <b>Tank</b> counter
                    <b>Melee</b>, <b>Melee</b> counters <b>Cannon</b> and
                    <b>Cannon</b> counters <b>Tank</b>. <br><br>
                    The game evolved and changed a lot during development. Initially the game was supposed to be in black
                    and white however after
                    a few feedback session with peer student artists and also prototyping I decided to move away from
                    this theme, since when viewed from far away the units could not be told apart and was
                    rather confusing for the player.<br><br>
                    Gameplay wise in the beginning the units were supposed to move in one lane from one end to the other
                    however in order to have more units
                    on the screen and make the gameplay interesting, it was changed to have a 3 lane system where the
                    user can decide which lane to spawn units.<br><br>

                <p>
                    In order to see how ECS architecture benefits gameplay development, complex gameplay systems have to
                    be build. As shown before
                    ECS does perform faster because of it's cache friendly design. However another aspect in game
                    development is workflow, or in other words,
                    how easy it is to create complex systems and how modular the design is.<br>
                    For <b>Graveyard Warz</b> various gameplay systems were build in order to find out how the
                    development in this architecture is.
                    Some of the main and complex systems are:
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Steering Behaviour System</b>, which applies different 3D forces to the units in order to
                        perform fluid movement
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Flocking System</b>, the system which keeps units separated from each other by applying
                        forces.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Projectile Motion System</b>, simulates any rigidbody to move in a projectile curve to reach
                        the a specified target position
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Menu and UI System</b>, supporting also text and sprite rendering in ECS style.</li>

                <h5 id="analysisphase">Analysis Phase</h5>

                <p>
                    During the Analysis phase the focus was researching about ECS architecture and Data-Oriented design.
                    Many different
                    ways of implementing this architecture were tested and prototyped.One of the biggest challenges
                    during
                    this phase was
                    finding a way to store data contiguously in memory but also find a way to maintain this sets of
                    data.<br>
                    There are many sources online explaining briefly what ECS is and why you should use it, however
                    there
                    are little to none concrete
                    examples on the topic. On of the best source found for the ECS was a blog by skypjack <a
                        href="https://skypjack.github.io/2019-02-14-ecs-baf-part-1/">[5]</a> which
                    discussed briefly a few implementation ideas and designs.
                    <br> In order to implement an basic ECS architecture, research on C and C++(meta programming) had to
                    be
                    done. The most reliable source for this topic and helped a lot in this project is the book Effective
                    Modern C++ <a
                        href="https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Modern-Specific-Ways-Improve/dp/1491903996">[6]</a>.<br>
                        This phase consists of implementation of the first prototype of Feather. In order for the prototype to
                    be
                    approved it had to be faster then the <b>Objected-Oriented</b> design,
                    thus tests were performed to prove the speed of the prototype.

                <p>
                    In the Design phase more work was put into the overall architecture of <b>Feather</b>. Research was
                    done on what features
                    other ECS frameworks offer and tried to implement some of them. One of the main features implemented
                    was the ability to query entities with a given set of components at runtime.<br>

                    The Crow Engine renderer was designed and build keeping this new architecture in mind.<br>
                    The last thing implemented was a prototype level which was parsed from Unity Engine where initial
                    gameplay systems could be tested.<br>
                    The biggest challenge of this phase was making the transition to the ECS workflow and building core
                    engine
                    using ECS architecture.<br>
                    In order to overcome this challenge, many versions of this systems were implemented and tested, for
                    example the ECS renderer was included in the engine
                    after it performed faster then Unity.

                <p>
                    The Production phase consists of development of the game and its core gameplay systems.Implementing the game as visioned proved to be rather challenging
                    at first but after peer feedback with artists, the work proceeded much smoother.<br>
                    <b>Feather</b> started to look more like a finished and stable ECS framework and a lot of
                    improvements were done based on the professional
                    feedback of <a href="http://www.joshcaratelli.com/">Josh Caratelli</a> who is a Software Engineer at
                    <a href="https://www.sledgehammergames.com/">Sledgehammer Games</a>, an
                    <a href="https://www.activision.com/">Activision</a> Studio. One of the main added feature was the
                    ability to iterate components using
                    a <b>ForEach</b> query which is similar to the way Unity's ECS framework called <a
                        href="https://unity.com/dots">DOTS</a>, iterates its components.
                    Another big feature was the implementation of <b>Sparse Sets</b> which increased the performance of
                    <b>Feather</b> significantly.

                <p>
                    The last planning phase consists of the Quality phase. The main focus of this phase was to polish the game
                    and make it more
                    visually appealing by adding fog and more post processing effects as well as designing the
                    level,adding more props and
                    tweaking gameplay values to make it more interesting.<br>
                    During this phase most of the codebase was cleaned up and documented.<br>
                    There were also added more code sugar features to <b>Feather</b> framework, like the ability to get all the
                    entities that fit a predefined condition
                    by using the <b>Find</b> method.<br>
                    This whole website was created from scatch using <b>HTMl</b>,<b>CSS</b> and <b>Bootstrap</b>. It
                    proved to be a challenge since

                <li><b>Support for SOA architecture</b>: Currently Feather is designed to support <b>AOS</b>(Array Of
                    Structs) memory architecture which means
                    the components(structs) are stored in arrays. However another way to store Data is in <b>SOA</b>(Struct
                    Of Arrays). This approach is fast
                    when we need to iterate groups of data that are linked with each other. A good read about how to go
                    about implementing this design can be found on skypjack's blog post about ECS groups <a
                            href="https://skypjack.github.io/2019-04-12-entt-tips-and-tricks-part-1/">[7]</a>.
                </li>
                <li><b>More custom collection types:</b> One of the reasons <b>ComponentSparseSet</b> was created is
                    because <b>UnorderedMap</b> of standard library in C++
                    proved to be much slower in the case of indexing and iterating components.
                    Even though custom collections were created in critical part of Feather, there are still
                    many other STL containers used in the codebase, which if replaced properly could lead to better
                    results.
                </li>
                <li><b>Less dependent on template meta-programming:</b> Feather currently uses C++ meta-programming to
                    deal with different type of structures. As powerful
                    as templates are they also have their own drawbacks, like being hard to debug in certain cases or
                    leading to bigger compile times.
                </li>

                <h6>Crow(Engine) Improvements:</h6>

                <li><b>Better optimised renderer</b>: The current engine renderer works good enough to showcase the
                    capabilities of <b>Feather</b>. However
                    as your game might scale up and better graphics might be requested it will become clearer that no
                    matter how many CPU optimisations are done
                    if the GPU is struggling, the game's framerate will drop a lot and it can't increase until the GPU
                    bottleneck is solved.
                </li>
                <li><b>Built in Editor</b> Using Unity's Editor saved a lot of development time and increased the
                    productivity in creating the game. Despite all this
                    an in built editor would be far more efficient and lead to quicker development increments.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <ul>
                <h6>GraveyardWarz(Game) Improvements:</h6>

                <li><b>More visual feedback</b>: One of the feedback gotten for the game is that it misses visual
                    feedback, like particle systems or animations. This
                    was not the main focus of the project but it is one thing that could add a lot to the game's look.
                </li>
                <li><b>Better gameplay design</b>: As mentioned on previous sections, the unit's design is very basic.
                    There could be more reason why a unit should be
                    prioritised instead of another one leading to more complex strategies. Also the game has no tutorial
                    so a well designed one could improve the new player's
                    experience.

            <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

            <p>
                The game,engine,and ECS framework built during this project helps drawing a conclusion to the main
                question: <b>What benefits does ECS architecture bring to Game and Engine development?</b><br><br>
                An overview of some of the main benefits ECS architecture brought to the development of this
                project are as per below:

            <ul>

                <li>Very Modular. By making your component small and independent all, then you can attach the
                    components to other entities and they will behave properly.
                </li>
                <li>No <b>null</b> exceptions. Since the data is pre-allocated and partitioned by <b>Feather</b> it
                    makes gameplay
                    systems easy to develop and bugs easy to find.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Very fast. As shown in the previous section the memory layout gives the ability to create
                    complex and heavy systems
                    without the need to multi-thread your application.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Focuses in the <b>data-oriented</b> development. Since the systems just modify small structures
                    of data it provides a more
                    maintainable code base. Changes are easy to implement.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Clear program call stack. Since neither inheritance or virtual function are used, the call stack
                    of the program is clear and easy
                    to step through making the program more debuggable.
                </li>

            </ul>

            <h2 id="reflection">Personal Reflection</h2>

            <p>
                During these 6 months I learned a lot about data-oriented design and low level programming. One of the
                things I wanted to work on myself was increasing my problem solving skills and how to approach harder
                problems that
                require individual research.<br>
                For this project I had to research many things in order to reach my goal and I can safely say my overall
                programming and
                problem solving skills have improved.<br>
                I also wanted to learn a lot not just about ECS but also about C and C++ increasing my overall knowledge
                of these languages
                since I had only done a few small projects using them.
                In the end of the project I can gladly say I am happy with the result. I have reached my goal and in
                certain areas done
                more then i expected myself to do.
